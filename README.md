# BCI
- This is a NSERC project being done by William Cui in Concordia University in 2018.
- I aim to control a EV3 robot, Wall-E, with brain computer interface, BCI.
- Hardware: 
  - EV3 MINDSTORM SET (Wall-E, the robot I assembled)
  - g.Nautilus Research
  - g.GAMMAcap2
- Softwave:
  - MATLAB 
    - **Support Package**: LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3

### Tasks
- [ ] Signal Acquisition (waiting for the softwave for the head set)
- [ ] Signal Processing
  - [ ] Signal Filtering
  - [ ] Signal Classification
- [ ] Robot Controling 
  - [ ] Signal Classes -> Robot Task Commands
  - [X] Robot Task Scripts (Forward, turn left and turn right)
